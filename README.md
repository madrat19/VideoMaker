# videoMaker
## Description:
This is a complete system for Youtube video generation. It parses Reddit posts, passes them through a bunch of technologies (like google text-to-speech or openAI language model) and makes a video based on it. Project is still in work so there may be some new features in the future.

Some data is hidden (api-keys, personal data) so code is not going to work out of the box.

## The result:
Our YouTube channels automated by this system:
